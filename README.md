# Habits Tracker

## Project Abstract

This project aimed to develop a habit tracking program called "Habits Tracker". The goal was to provide users with a tool that helps them manage, monitor, analyze, and keep track of their habits effectively and efficiently.

## Technical Approach

The project was implemented using Python as the primary programming language. It utilized:
- **JSON** for data storage
- **OS module** for file system operations
- **PrettyTable library** for displaying the stored data in a tabular format
- **datetime library** for date and time operations

## Challenges

One of the main challenges of working on this project was managing the timeframes and streaks effectively. Addressing this challenge required careful handling of dates while considering the implementation of a streak tracking system.

## Features

Noteworthy features that were not expected during the initial development include:
- Dynamic table display for a better user experience
- Color coding text, which also helps with user experience and a better understanding and analysis of the information displayed
